NPPS hosted an [EIC simulation meeting](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/6336/) on July 10 to progress on how to improve commonality and ease of use among the simulation tools, to allow users to work with multiple detector concepts easily without learning several different systems. The meeting concluded with a set of agreements to enable this; see the [meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EvE1vaEJ59YM5XWLDK4ScVSbVPFxoOhpz2OI8nquB04/edit#heading=h.537ah7j0yh7e).
