The EIC Simulation Infrastructure Project in the NPPS group is developing detector simulation capabilities for application in the ePIC experiment and elsewhere. Focus areas are

- detailed simulation of Cerenkov particle ID detectors based on detailed Geant4 simulation incorporating optical photon propagation software that can leverage GPUs
- integrated fast and full simulation in one Geant4 based infrastructure supporting selectable levels of detail as appropriate to the physics problem
- user interface tools supporting convenient access to ESI capabilities, and more generally enhancing usability and capability of the ePIC software stack

The ESI project is supported by LDRD funds.
