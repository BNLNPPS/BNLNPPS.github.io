The EIC Simulation Infrastructure Project in the NPPS group is developing detector simulation capabilities for application in the ePIC experiment and elsewhere. Focus areas are

- detailed simulation of Cerenkov particle ID detectors based on Geant4 simulation and optical photon propagation software that can leverage GPUs
- integrated fast and full simulation in one Geant4 based infrastructure supporting selectable levels of detail as appropriate to the physics problem,

ESI is a project that aims to develop a scalable and distributed AI-assisted detector design for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to optimize the design of EIC detectors, principally ePIC at present. It is supported by DOE NP. Project PI is Cristiano Fanelli (William & Mary), BNL PI is Torre Wenaus.
