The Electron Ion Collider (EIC) is a future nuclear physics facility that will provide electron-nucleon and electron-nucleus collisions at unprecedented luminosities and energies. It will be built at BNL with construction starting after the final RHIC run in 2025. The EIC has two host labs, BNL and JLab, collaborating on all aspects of the machine and its funded experiment, ePIC. 

NPPS involvement in EIC today is primarily in the ePIC experiment which has a very active software and computing program.
