The REDWOOD project aims to optimize the resilience, throughput, and resource utilization afforded by federated workflows in a heterogeneous computing environment by optimally and intelligently placing data and computational resources. The project will design and develop an intelligent, introspective, and dynamic workflow based on a system model built with years of data captured from important exemplars of large-scale experimental facilities, in particular the PanDA workload management system developed largely by NPPS.

REDWOOD is a collaboration between high energy physicists and computer scientists at several labs and universities, led by BNL PI Alexei Klimentov. It is supported by DOE ASCR.
