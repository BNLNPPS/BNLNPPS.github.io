LuSEE@Night is the Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment (LuSEE) to be landed on the dark side of the moon, a radio astronomy instrument.
It will probe the plasma and dust environments of the farside and will make the first cosmological observations from the
Moon using the redshifted 21-cm hydrogen spectrum.

NPPS developed LuSEE@Night software and infrastructure during the experiment's development.
