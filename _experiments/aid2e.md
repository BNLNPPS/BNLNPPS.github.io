AID2E is a project that aims to develop a scalable and distributed AI-assisted detector design for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to optimize the design of EIC detectors, principally ePIC at present. It is supported by DOE NP. Project PI is Cristiano Fanelli (William & Mary), BNL PI is Torre Wenaus.
