The Production and Distributed Analysis (PanDA) system is a data-driven workload management system engineered to operate at LHC data processing scales, including HL-LHC. The PanDA system provides a solution for scientific experiments to fully leverage their distributed heterogeneous resources, showcasing scalability, usability, flexibility, and robustness. The system has successfully proven itself through nearly two decades of steady operation in the ATLAS experiment, addressing the intricate requirements such as diverse resources distributed worldwide at about 200 sites, thousands of scientists analyzing the data remotely, the volume of processed data beyond the exabyte scale, dozens of scientific applications to support, and data processing over several billion hours of computing usage per year.

PanDA was developed primarily by NPPS and the University of Texas at Arlington. The system is open-source and has been adopted by other experiments and projects including the Rubin Observatory.
