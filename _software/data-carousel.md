### Description

The data carousel R&D project is an ATLAS initiative originating at BNL to develop a disk-efficient means of processing data residing in cold storage (tape). Workload and data management systems together with the site's storage services orchestrate the staging and processing of a dynamic sliding window of disk-resident data, such that the disk footprint of the production campaign's input data is just a fraction of its full size.
