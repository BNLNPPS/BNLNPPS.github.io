The EIC Software Infrastructure (ESI) project in NPPS is developing a number of software tools in the course of its work, including an adaptation 'esi-shell' of the ePIC-standard eic-shell capable of executing GPU-accelerated simulations, software for simulating Cerenkov optical photons in a detector using GPUs, and other Cerenkov detector simulation software.
