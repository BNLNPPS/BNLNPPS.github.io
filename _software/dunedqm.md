synopsis: The "protoDUNE prompt processing system" (abbreviated as p3s) is used in the protoDUNE-SP experiment at CERN in order to provide Data Quality Monitoring capabilities. It is a combination of a simple workload management system and a content server, both implemented within the Django web application framework. A characteristic feature of the system is self-describing data which allows integration of new computational payloads without changes in the server code.
